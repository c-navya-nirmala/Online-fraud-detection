## Fraud Detection Machine Learning Pipeline

### Data Exploration and Preprocessing

1. **Loading Data:** Read a CSV file ('onlinefraud.csv') into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. **Data Overview:** Display the first few rows, info, and descriptive statistics of the dataset.
3. **Fraud Distribution:** Check the distribution of fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions.
4. **Sampling Data:** Create a balanced sample of data for both fraud and non-fraud cases.
5. **Data Visualization:** Plot a count of transaction types and a histogram of the 'step' feature.
6. **Correlation Matrix:** Explore the correlation between numerical features.

### Data Preprocessing

7. **One-Hot Encoding:** Convert categorical 'type' variable into dummy variables.
8. **Feature and Target Split:** Prepare features (X) and target variable (y).
9. **Train-Test Split and Scaling:** Split the data into training and testing sets, and standardize numerical features.

### Model Building and Evaluation

10. **Logistic Regression:** Train a logistic regression model and evaluate its performance.
11. **Random Forest Classifier:** Train a random forest classifier and evaluate its performance.
12. **Support Vector Machine (SVM):** Train an SVM model and evaluate its performance.
13. **XGBoost Classifier:** Train an XGBoost model and evaluate its performance.

### Additional Model Evaluation

14. **Comparison of Different Models:** Train multiple models and compare their training and validation accuracy.

### Confusion Matrix and Visualization

15. **Confusion Matrix:** Visualize the confusion matrix for a chosen model (XGBoost).
16. **Plotting Confusion Matrix:** Display a heatmap of the confusion matrix.

### Making Predictions on Test Data

17. **Prediction Example:** Use the trained XGBoost model to make predictions on test data and showcase the predicted values and probability scores.

Note: This code covers the entire machine learning pipeline, from data loading and preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and making predictions on new data.
